# Coming Soon!!

As part of the Advanced Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, I am currently diving into key statistical concepts essential for data analysis through 'The Power of Statistics' course. My learning journey has progressed into a hands-on capstone project focused on real-world data analysis, applying statistical techniques to gain insights from TikTok video interaction data.

***Current Project:*** TikTok Hypothesis Test Analysis

***Project Goal:***

Perform a hypothesis test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in video view counts between verified and unverified TikTok accounts and communicate insights with stakeholders.

***Key Action Items:***

* Emails - Identify and list all required deliverables – Completed

* Determine the Most Insightful Variable – In Progress (testing statistical differences between verified and unverified accounts)

* Compute Descriptive Statistics – In Progress (for claims classification data)

* Conduct a Two-Sample Hypothesis Test – In Progress (comparing video view counts for verified versus unverified accounts)

* Conduct Statistical Testing – In Progress (hypothesis testing for verified vs. unverified accounts)

* Prepare a Summary of the Results – Not Started (for internal review)

* Write an Executive Summary – Not Started (overview of key findings from statistical testing, aimed at non-technical stakeholders)

Upon completion of this project, I will update this repository with the next stage of my capstone project, showcasing the data-driven insights, results, and professional artifact that will be added to my portfolio.

# Coming Soon!!

In the upcoming stages of my learning journey through "The Power of Statistics" course, I will deepen my understanding of key statistical concepts essential for data analysis. Here's a brief overview of what I'm currently learning:

* Introduction to Statistics: Mastering fundamental concepts like descriptive statistics, including measures of central tendency, dispersion, and position.

* Probability: Exploring basic probability rules, conditional probability, Bayes's theorem, and key probability distributions such as binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions.

* Sampling: Understanding the relationship between sample and population, different sampling methods, and the importance of sampling distributions.

* Confidence Intervals: Learning how to construct and interpret confidence intervals to quantify uncertainty in data estimates.

* Hypothesis Testing: Gaining skills in conducting and interpreting hypothesis tests to determine the statistical significance of results.

* Capstone Project: Applying my statistical knowledge in a real-world scenario to create a professional artifact that will be added to my portfolio.

Upon completion, I will update my portfolio with the next stage of my capstone project, showcasing the skills and knowledge gained.

# TikTok-Capstone-Project

![TikTok Logo](Images/Optimizing_Content_Moderation_with_Machine_Learning.png)

**Welcome!**  

This repository showcases my completed project, developed as part of the Advanced Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The initiative reflects a structured and methodical approach to solving real-world challenges in content moderation using data analytics and machine learning.

The project spans the entire analytics lifecycle, including:

- **Defining Objectives:** Deriving tasks and deliverables from stakeholder communications and emails.
- **Planning:** Creating project proposals, workflows, and timelines.
- **Development:** Building Jupyter Notebooks to clean data, develop models, and evaluate performance.
- **Visualization:** Designing Tableau dashboards to present key insights.
- **Delivery:** Crafting executive summaries and detailed reports for stakeholders.

The goal of this project was to classify TikTok user interactions as claims or opinions, leveraging machine learning to enhance moderation efficiency, reduce backlogs, and improve user experience. This repository highlights cross-functional collaboration, technical expertise, and the ability to deliver actionable insights, making it a valuable example of applied data analytics and machine learning.
